# Machine-Learning

Mission Statement
○ The goal of this project is to develop a highly accurate predictive model to
determine the outcomes of football matches — either a home win (H), an away
win (A), or a draw (D). This tool is primarily designed for sports analysts, betting
enthusiasts, and sports strategists. By enhancing prediction accuracy, the model
aims to improve strategic decision-making in sports management and betting
industries, potentially increasing profits and optimizing team performance by
focusing on critical in-game statistics.
● Method
○ Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
■ Source of Data
● The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the English
Premiere League Team Datasets, which provided a comprehensive
set of match statistics.
■ Data Cleaning
● The dataset was already clean, necessitating only the removal of
unnecessary features and the renaming of columns to improve
interpretability.
■ Feature Engineering
● Initial model performance was suboptimal, prompting the
introduction of feature engineering to enhance accuracy.
● Result Mapping
○ Transforming match outcomes into numerical points to
quantify match results for better analysis.
● Recent Form Calculation
○ Implementing rolling averages to capture the form of both
home and away teams over the last three matches,
providing dynamic insights into team performance trends.
● Model Implementation
○ Choice of Model
■ The Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its ability to handle
diverse data types effectively and its robustness against overfitting. This
model's ensemble approach, leveraging multiple decision trees, enhances
both accuracy and stability.
○ Parameter Tuning
■ Initial Setup
● The n_estimators parameter was set to 100, yielding a 62%
accuracy.
■ Adjustment and Tuning
● After initial results, n_estimators was increased to 155, improving
accuracy to 67%. Further refinement through hyperparameter
tuning via GridSearchCV optimized the model parameters,
significantly enhancing performance.
○ Encoding Strategy
■ Transitioned from label encoding to one-hot encoding to better handle
categorical variables by removing any implicit ordinal relationships, thus
preventing model bias.
● Validation Strategy
○ Evaluation Metrics
■ Employed a confusion matrix alongside precision, recall, and F1-score to
provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance.
○ Data Splitting
■ Adjusted the train-test split from a 70:30 to a 75:25 ratio after initial trials,
and reverted to 70:30 post-enhancements, which supported achieving an
83% accuracy rate.
○ Cross-Validation
■ Utilized a 5-fold cross-validation method within GridSearchCV, ensuring
robustness and generalizability of the model across different data subsets.
● Results and Conclusion
○ Performance Enhancements
■ Key Improvements
● Significant performance gains were driven by strategic
hyperparameter tuning and advanced feature engineering. The
translation of match outcomes into a points system was particularly
impactful, aligning the data more closely with the inherent
objectives of football scoring.
■ Challenges and Responses
● Initial disappointments with a 62% accuracy prompted a rigorous
reassessment of methodologies, leading to targeted improvements
in feature engineering and model tuning that substantially elevated
the model's predictive capability.
○ Future Directions and Conclusion
■ Next Steps
● Continued enhancement of the model through additional feature
engineering and incorporation of more comprehensive datasets,
including more detailed player and match statistics like possession
metrics and player performance indices.
■ Long-Term Vision
● The model is expected to evolve with advancements in data
collection technologies, such as player tracking and performance
monitoring, which will enrich the dataset and potentially boost
predictive accuracy further.
■ Technological Impact
● Ongoing developments in sports analytics technology will likely
streamline data integration and model refinement processes,
supporting sustained improvements in predictive accuracy and
utility.
● Ethical and Social Considerations
○ The project exclusively uses publicly available data provided by Kaggle, which is
accessible legally to anyone. We do not anticipate any ethical or social challenges
when using this data.
○ We commit to maintaining transparency in our methodology and ensuring that our
findings are presented with an understanding of their predictive nature and the
model's limitations.
This report outlines the comprehensive approach undertaken to develop a predictive model for
football match outcomes, highlighting the iterative process of tuning and enhancement that led to
