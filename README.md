# Football Match Outcome Predictor

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model to forecast the outcomes of football matches within the English Premier League. It targets sports analysts, betting enthusiasts, and strategists, offering insights that could enhance decision-making in sports management and betting industries.

## Features
- Predicts three possible outcomes: Home win (H), Away win (A), or Draw (D).
- Utilizes historical match data from the English Premier League.
- Employs a Random Forest Classifier, renowned for its effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's [English Premiere League Team Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lumierebatalong/english-premiere-league-team-datasets). It includes detailed match statistics over several seasons, specifically focusing on team performance metrics like goals, shots, fouls, and more.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation
- **Cleaning**: Simplification of dataset by removing unnecessary features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancement of model accuracy through the creation of new features such as team form over the last three matches.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Chosen for its robustness and ability to prevent overfitting, enhanced through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Validation**: Employed confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for a thorough performance evaluation.
- **Cross-Validation**: Utilized a 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.

## Usage
To run the model:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook match_outcome_predictor.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of approximately 83% after extensive tuning and feature engineering. It provides reliable predictions that can significantly influence strategic betting and team management decisions.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional match-specific data like player statistics and in-game events.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods to further improve prediction accuracy.
